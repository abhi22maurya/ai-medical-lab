# AI-based Medical Laboratory  
*March 18, 2025*  

## Project Overview  
The AI-based Medical Laboratory project seeks to revolutionize laboratory medicine by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The goal is to enhance the precision and speed of lab processes, minimize human errors, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.  

## Features  
- **Customer Module**: Facilitates sample submissions and result retrieval for patients.  
- **Doctor Module**: Empowers doctors to analyze lab results for informed decision-making.  
- **Lab Assistant Module**: Assists technicians in sample management and analysis with AI/ML tools.  

## Pros and Cons  

**Pros**:  
- Improved precision and efficiency in lab processes.  
- Reduced human errors and operational costs.  
- Enhanced patient satisfaction and outcomes.  

**Cons**:  
- Challenges in ensuring data quality and availability.  
- High computational resource requirements.  
- Trust, acceptance, and education hurdles.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: React, Redux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
- **AI/ML Tools**: Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  

## Project Structure  
- `frontend`: React-based frontend code.  
- `backend`: Backend built with Node.js and Express.  

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js and npm installed.  
- MongoDB installed and running.  

### Steps  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository-link>  
   cd ai-medical-lab  
   ```  

2. Install backend dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   cd backend  
   npm install  
   ```  

3. Install frontend dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   cd ../frontend  
   npm install  
   ```  

4. Set up environment variables:  
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with:  
   ```text  
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri  
   PORT=5000  
   ```  

5. Run the backend server:  
   ```bash  
   cd ../backend  
   npm start  
   ```  

6. Run the frontend server:  
   ```bash  
   cd ../frontend  
   npm start  
   ```  

## Usage  
Access the application at `http://localhost:5173` to interact with Customer, Doctor, and Lab Assistant modules.
